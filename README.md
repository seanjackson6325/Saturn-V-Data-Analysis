# Saturn-V-Data-Analysis

This is a program I made for a PHY224 lab at the University of Toronto.
Given some position (with uncertainty) and time data about the Saturn V rocket,
I developed methods to accurately predict the position of the Command Module on
it's journey to the moon.

I used a linear regression algorithm to find a linear function
desribing the rocket's position, and I also used the curve_fit
function provided by matplotlib. I compared the results of these
two functions on the plot, and the result was that there is little
to no difference between the two methods.

Please view "rocket_data_complete.jpg" to see the result of the analysis.
